# SeismoML: generative models for deep learning-accelerated Bayesian inference of seismic events

This is the repository for the paper `"Towards fast machine-learning-assisted Bayesian posterior inference of microseismic event location and source mechanism"` by Piras et al. The repository is a work in progress, and will be updated as soon as the paper is accepted and ready for publication. Stay tuned!

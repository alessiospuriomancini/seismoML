# SeismoML: generative models for deep learning-accelerated Bayesian inference of seismic events

This is the repository for the paper [`"Towards fast machine-learning-assisted Bayesian posterior inference of microseismic event location and source mechanism"`](https://academic.oup.com/gji/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/gji/ggac385/6750231?utm_source=advanceaccess&utm_campaign=gji&utm_medium=email) by Piras et al. The repository contains most material to reproduce the results of the paper, or descriptions on how to do it. If anything is unclear, or if you need access to any dataset that is not available here, do not hesitate to send an email to [Davide Piras](mailto:dr.davide.piras@gmail.com).

## Installation
We recommend creating a fresh `conda` environment, and install all packages listed in `requirements.txt`. The work presented in the paper has been done with `python 3.6.10` (now outdated), but it should work seamlessly even with more recent versions.

    conda create -n seismoML python=3.6.10
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# seismoML
This repository contains the work to reproduce the results in [Spurio Mancini, Piras, Hobson, Joachimi 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06758v1) and [Piras, Spurio Mancini, Joachimi, Hobson 2021 - in preparation](https://dpiras.github.io/404). The code will be accompanied by example notebooks where we explain how one can use generative models in machine learning (ML) combined with Bayesian tools in order to massively speed-up the localisation of microseismic events under the seabed. The whole code will be released after the papers have been peer-reviewed and accepted, so watch this space!
